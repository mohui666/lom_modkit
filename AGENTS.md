## Game features require decompiled APIs

If the work touches *game functionality* — Combat, Battle, saves, shops,
stats, flags, talents, items, scenes, UI panels, characters, Addressables,
or any other official *Legend of Mortal* type — **read the decompiled
interface first**. Do not invent methods, fields, scene keys, or result
codes from memory or from old comments.

Required sources, in order:

1. [`research/gameplay_api.md`](research/gameplay_api.md) — confirmed
   signatures and what they may be used for.
2. [`research/gameplay_api_contract.json`](research/gameplay_api_contract.json)
   — assembly hashes and the exact fragments that must still match.
3. Live decompile of the installed game (do not reuse stale snippets):

   ```powershell
   ilspycmd -t Mortal.Battle.ReadyPanel `
     "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\LegendOfMortal\Mortal_Data\Managed\Mortal.Battle.dll"
   ```

   Prefer the game’s `Mortal_Data/Managed/*.dll`. Frozen copies under
   [`docs/research/decompiled/`](docs/research/decompiled/) are an
   archive only; they do not include `Mortal.Battle` / `Mortal.Combat`.
4. After a game update, run `python tools/verify_gameplay_api.py --json`
   before keeping old conclusions.

Do **not** commit or upload full decompiled game source
(`docs/research/decompiled/**`, `ilspycmd -p` dumps, extracted assets).
That is the game's code. It is already gitignored. What *may* live in
the repo is our own notes: method names we hook, assembly hashes, and
the workflow in `docs/chs/decompiled_api.md`.

How to use a decompiled type:

- Quote the type and method you actually called (`ReadyPanel.Setup`,
  `CharacterHealth.MaxHealth`, `NpcSpawner.InitNpcList`, …).
- Patch or wrap that entry. Do not mutate official ScriptableObject
  assets; clone per instance when a value must change.
- If the type is missing, the field is private with no safe hook, or the
  hash no longer matches: stop and record it. Do not guess a nearby API.

Docs map: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). The decompile workflow is
[`docs/chs/decompiled_api.md`](docs/chs/decompiled_api.md). The v3
package contract is [`docs/chs/mod_format.md`](docs/chs/mod_format.md).
